🛳️ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python to extract insights, patterns, and trends related to passenger survival.

🧰 Tools Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains details of passengers aboard the Titanic, including:

Passenger information (Name, Sex, Age)

Ticket class (Pclass)

Number of siblings/spouses (SibSp)

Number of parents/children (Parch)

Fare and embarkation point (Embarked)

Survival status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)

🔍 Key Analysis Performed

Data cleaning and handling missing values

Summary statistics and data overview

Value counts for categorical columns

Visualization of relationships using:

Countplots

Histograms

Boxplots

Heatmap (for correlations)

Pairplot (for relationships)

Identification of survival patterns by gender, class, and age

📈 Insights / Observations

Females had higher survival rates than males.

First-class passengers had greater survival chances than third-class.

Younger passengers were more likely to survive.

Survival strongly depended on Sex, Age, and Pclass.
